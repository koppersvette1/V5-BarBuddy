File 08.0 - Spirit Substitution Guide
BarBuddy V5 - The "MacGyver" Guide
Philosophy: Sometimes you're missing an ingredient. Sometimes you want to experiment. This guide shows you what works and WHY, not just "use vodka instead."
I. SUBSTITUTION RULES (The Science)
Rule #1: Match Flavor Profile
Similar profiles swap well: Bourbon ↔ Aged Rum (both have vanilla, caramel from barrel aging).
Rule #2: Match ABV
Similar alcohol content: 40% spirit → 40% spirit. Don't swap a base spirit for a low-ABV liqueur.
Rule #3: Consider Smoke
Smoked cocktails: Barrel-aged spirits work best (whiskey, rum, reposado tequila). Clear spirits (vodka, gin) often taste harsh when smoked unless you use fruit woods.
II. COMPLETE SUBSTITUTION MATRIX
WHISKEY/BOURBON SUBSTITUTIONS
Standard Drink: Old Fashioned, Whiskey Sour
Primary Sub: Aged Rum (Dark/Gold)
Why: Similar barrel aging, vanilla notes, caramel.
Result: Slightly sweeter, tropical undertones.
Secondary Sub: Reposado/Añejo Tequila
Why: Barrel-aged, similar ABV, agave sweetness.
Result: More vegetal, earthy, less sweet.
Tertiary Sub: Brandy/Cognac
Why: Barrel-aged, fruit-forward.
Result: Fruitier, softer, more elegant.
GIN SUBSTITUTIONS
Standard Drink: Martini, Negroni, G&T
Primary Sub: Vodka
Why: Neutral grain spirit.
Result: Removes the botanical/herbal flavor, making the drink cleaner but simpler.
Secondary Sub: Blanco Tequila
Why: Herbal, vegetable notes mimic botanicals slightly.
Result: "Mexican Martini" or "Tequila Negroni" (Rosita).
Tertiary Sub: Aquavit
Why: Nordic spirit spiced with caraway/dill instead of juniper.
Result: Savory, spicy, very complex.
RUM SUBSTITUTIONS
Standard Drink: Daiquiri, Mojito, Tiki
Primary Sub (White Rum): Vodka
Why: Neutral.
Result: Loses the sugarcane funk, becomes just sweet/sour.
Primary Sub (Dark Rum): Bourbon
Why: Oak, caramel, vanilla.
Result: Makes the drink heavier and grainier.
Secondary Sub: Cachaça
Why: Brazilian sugarcane spirit.
Result: Grassy, funkier, wilder flavor.
TEQUILA SUBSTITUTIONS
Standard Drink: Margarita, Paloma
Primary Sub: Mezcal
Why: Agave cousin, cooked underground.
Result: Smokier, earthier, more robust.
Secondary Sub: Vodka
Why: Neutral canvas for the lime/salt.
Result: A "Kamikaze" is basically a Vodka Margarita.
Tertiary Sub: White Rum
Why: Clear, slightly sweet.
Result: A Daiquiri with salt.
III. MODIFIER SUBSTITUTIONS (The Small Stuff)
| Missing Item | Best Substitute | Notes |
| Cointreau / Triple Sec | Grand Marnier, Curaçao, Simple Syrup + Orange Bitters | If removing the liqueur, add 0.25oz sugar syrup to balance. |
| Sweet Vermouth | Port, Sherry, Lillet Rouge | Any fortified sweet red wine works in a pinch. |
| Dry Vermouth | Lillet Blanc, Dry Sherry, Sauvignon Blanc | White wine is thinner/less herbal but works. |
| Simple Syrup | Agave Nectar, Honey, Maple Syrup | Maple adds flavor; Agave is sweeter (use less). |
| Lemon/Lime Juice | Vinegar (Shrub), Citric Acid solution | DO NOT use bottled juice. Vinegar works for sours if balanced with sugar. |
