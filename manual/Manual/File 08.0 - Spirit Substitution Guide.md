File 08.0 - Spirit Substitution GuideBarBuddy V5 - The "MacGyver" GuidePhilosophy: Sometimes you're missing an ingredient. Sometimes you want to experiment. This guide shows you what works and WHY, not just "use vodka instead."I. SUBSTITUTION RULES (The Science)Rule #1: Match Flavor ProfileSimilar profiles swap well: Bourbon ↔ Aged Rum (both have vanilla, caramel from barrel aging).Rule #2: Match ABVSimilar alcohol content: 40% spirit → 40% spirit. Don't swap a base spirit for a low-ABV liqueur.Rule #3: Consider SmokeSmoked cocktails: Barrel-aged spirits work best (whiskey, rum, reposado tequila). Clear spirits (vodka, gin) often taste harsh when smoked unless you use fruit woods.II. COMPLETE SUBSTITUTION MATRIXWHISKEY/BOURBON SUBSTITUTIONSStandard Drink: Old Fashioned, Whiskey SourPrimary Sub: Aged Rum (Dark/Gold)Why: Similar barrel aging, vanilla notes, caramel.Result: Slightly sweeter, tropical undertones.Secondary Sub: Reposado/Añejo TequilaWhy: Barrel-aged, similar ABV, agave sweetness.Result: More vegetal, earthy, less sweet.Tertiary Sub: Brandy/CognacWhy: Barrel-aged, fruit-forward.Result: Fruitier, softer, more elegant.GIN SUBSTITUTIONSStandard Drink: Martini, Negroni, G&TPrimary Sub: VodkaWhy: Neutral grain spirit.Result: Removes the botanical/herbal flavor, making the drink cleaner but simpler.Secondary Sub: Blanco TequilaWhy: Herbal, vegetable notes mimic botanicals slightly.Result: "Mexican Martini" or "Tequila Negroni" (Rosita).Tertiary Sub: AquavitWhy: Nordic spirit spiced with caraway/dill instead of juniper.Result: Savory, spicy, very complex.RUM SUBSTITUTIONSStandard Drink: Daiquiri, Mojito, TikiPrimary Sub (White Rum): VodkaWhy: Neutral.Result: Loses the sugarcane funk, becomes just sweet/sour.Primary Sub (Dark Rum): BourbonWhy: Oak, caramel, vanilla.Result: Makes the drink heavier and grainier.Secondary Sub: CachaçaWhy: Brazilian sugarcane spirit.Result: Grassy, funkier, wilder flavor.TEQUILA SUBSTITUTIONSStandard Drink: Margarita, PalomaPrimary Sub: MezcalWhy: Agave cousin, cooked underground.Result: Smokier, earthier, more robust.Secondary Sub: VodkaWhy: Neutral canvas for the lime/salt.Result: A "Kamikaze" is basically a Vodka Margarita.Tertiary Sub: White RumWhy: Clear, slightly sweet.Result: A Daiquiri with salt.III. SMOKING CONSIDERATIONSIf you are substituting the base spirit in a Smoked Cocktail (e.g., Smoked Old Fashioned), follow these rules:✅ GOOD FOR SMOKINGBourbon / Rye: The gold standard.Aged Rum: Excellent. Pairs with Cherry/Oak.Reposado Tequila: Great. Pairs with Mesquite.Mezcal: Already smoky, but can handle more.Brandy: Good with fruit woods (Apple/Pear).❌ BAD FOR SMOKING (Unless you are careful)Vodka: Absorbs smoke too easily; tastes like ashtray quickly. Use 50% less smoke time.Gin: Smoke fights with the pine/juniper notes. Use Apple wood only.White Rum: Often tastes harsh when smoked.IV. MODIFIER SUBSTITUTIONS (The Small Stuff)Missing ItemBest SubstituteNotesCointreau / Triple SecGrand Marnier, Curaçao, Simple Syrup + Orange BittersIf removing the liqueur, add 0.25oz sugar syrup to balance.Sweet VermouthPort, Sherry, Lillet RougeAny fortified sweet red wine works in a pinch.Dry VermouthLillet Blanc, Dry Sherry, Sauvignon BlancWhite wine is thinner/less herbal but works.Simple SyrupAgave Nectar, Honey, Maple SyrupMaple adds flavor; Agave is sweeter (use less).Lemon/Lime JuiceVinegar (Shrub), Citric Acid solutionDO NOT use bottled juice. Vinegar works for sours if balanced with sugar.END OF FILE 08.0
