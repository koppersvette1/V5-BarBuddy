BarBuddy V5 - Pro Methods
Philosophy: These techniques separate the home bartender from the professional mixologist. They focus on altering texture, maximizing yield, and extracting flavor at a molecular level.

II. FAT WASHING (Texture & Savory Flavor)
Concept: Infusing a spirit with the flavor of a fat (bacon, butter, coconut oil) without making it greasy. The freezing process solidifies the fat so it can be removed, leaving only the flavor molecules.
Best Combinations:
Bacon + Bourbon: For Smoky Old Fashioneds.
Brown Butter + Rum: For Spiced Daiquiris or Hot Toddies.
Coconut Oil + Campari: Softens the bitterness for tropical Negronis.
Sesame Oil + Gin: For savory highballs.
The "Bacon Bourbon" Method:
Cook 6 strips of bacon. Save the rendered liquid fat (approx 1.5 oz).
Pour warm liquid fat into a jar with 750ml (1 bottle) of Bourbon.
Shake and let sit at room temp for 4 hours to infuse.
Place in freezer overnight (12+ hours). The fat will form a solid frozen disc on top.
Poke a hole in the fat disc and pour the liquid through a coffee filter or cheesecloth.
Result: Clear spirit with a silky mouthfeel and smoky taste.
III. CLARIFIED MILK PUNCH (Batching & Smoothness)
Concept: Using milk curdling to strip color, tannins, and harshness from a drink, leaving it crystal clear and shelf-stable.
The Golden Ratio: 4 Parts Cocktail Mix : 1 Part Whole Milk.
The Protocol:
Mix the Punch: Combine spirits, citrus (acid is essential), sugar, and tea/spices. Do not add water/ice.
The Pour: Pour the cocktail mixture INTO the cold milk. Never pour milk into acid (it creates tiny curds that won't filter).
The Wait: Let it sit for 1 hour. It will look curdled and gross. This is good.
The Filter: Line a strainer with a coffee filter (or cheesecloth). Pour the mixture through.
The Recycle: The first few ounces will be cloudy. Pour them back through the filter. Once it runs clear, collect the rest.
Result: A golden, crystal-clear liquid with a thick, creamy mouthfeel but no dairy flavor. Keeps in the fridge for months.
IV. SUPER JUICE (Acid Adjusting & Yield)
Concept: Getting 8x more juice from a lime by extracting oils from the peel and mixing with citric acid. Tastes fresh for 2-3 weeks instead of 1 day.
Lime Super Juice Formula:
Peel 6 Limes (peels only, minimize white pith).
Weigh the peels (e.g., 50g).
Add Citric Acid equal to 0.66x peel weight (33g).
Add Malic Acid equal to 0.33x peel weight (17g).
Muddle peels and acids. Let sit 1 hour to extract oils (Oleo Citrate).
Add Water equal to 16.6x peel weight (830g).
Blend everything. Strain through fine mesh.
Result: Identical acidity to fresh lime juice, but shelf-stable and higher yield.
V. RAPID INFUSIONS (Speed)
Concept: Forcing flavor into alcohol instantly using pressure or heat, rather than waiting weeks.
Method A: The Whipping Siphon (Nitrous Oxide)
Best For: Delicate herbs, fresh fruit (e.g., Basil Gin, Jalapeño Tequila).
How:
Put herbs/fruit and spirit into a whipped cream dispenser (ISI).
Charge with 2 N2O cartridges. Shake.
Let sit 2 minutes.
Vent gas rapidly (release pressure).
Strain. The pressure forces liquid into the plant cells instantly.
Method B: Sous Vide (Heat)
Best For: Hard spices, dried fruit, nuts (e.g., Cinnamon Whiskey).
How:
Seal ingredients and spirit in a vacuum bag or mason jar.
Cook in water bath at 135°F (57°C) for 2 hours.
Chill and strain.
VI. TEXTURE HACKS (Foams & Airs)
1. The Regal Shake
Technique: Place a grapefruit or orange peel inside the shaker tin with your ice and ingredients.
Result: The ice beats the oils out of the peel during the shake, infusing the entire drink with intense aromatics (more than just a garnish).
2. Saline Solution (Salt)
Why: Salt suppresses bitterness and amplifies citrus. It makes everything "pop."
Recipe: Mix 20g Sea Salt into 80g Water (20% solution).
Usage: Add 2 drops to every citrus cocktail. It is a game changer.
3. Dry Shake vs. Reverse Dry Shake
Standard Dry Shake: Shake without ice first, then add ice and shake again. (Good foam).
Reverse Dry Shake: Shake WITH ice first, strain out ice, then shake liquid again. (Huge, meringue-like foam). Best for Whiskey Sours.
VII. BATCHING FOR PARTIES (The Host Hack)
The Problem: Cocktails stirred/shaken à la minute have 20-25% water added via ice melt. Pre-batched drinks in a bottle are undiluted and too strong.
The Formula:
Total Volume: (Ingredients x Servings) + (Dilution Water).
Dilution Rule: Add 20% water by volume to the bottle.
Example: 1 Liter of Negroni mix needs approx 200ml of water added before bottling.
Storage: Keep in freezer. Because water is added, you can pour straight into a glass without stirring.
