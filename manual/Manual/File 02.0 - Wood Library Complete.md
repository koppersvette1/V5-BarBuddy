BarBuddy V5 - Smoke & Flavor Guide
Philosophy: Wood chips are functional ingredients, not just aromatics. They are "Fixers" used to add specific flavor compounds to enhance or repair a drink's profile. This library details the profiles of woods, herbs, and spices used in cocktail smoking.

Pro-Tip
Cherry
Mild/Medium
8-10s
Sweet, fruity, slight tartness
The Softener: Rounds off sharp alcohol burn with fruity sweetness.
Bourbon, Rye, Amaretto
Gin, Tequila (Blanco)
The safest bet for beginners; almost impossible to over-smoke.
Oak
Medium
8-10s
Vanilla, toast, caramel, earthy
The Ager: Mimics barrel aging. Adds depth and "brown" notes to young spirits.
Manhattan, Martini, Scotch
Fruity Tiki drinks
Use Post-Oak for a Texas BBQ vibe; White Oak for vanilla notes.
Apple
Mild
10-12s
Very sweet, subtle, light char
The Sweetener: Adds a candy-like top note without heaviness.
Gin, White Rum, Vodka
Heavy Scotch, Mezcal
Needs a longer smoke time to fully express flavor.
Hickory
Strong
4-6s
Bacon, campfire, pungent
The Punch: Adds a savory, meaty backbone. Use sparingly.
Bloody Mary, Bourbon
Delicate Sours, Gin
High risk of bitterness; mix 50/50 with Apple to tame it.
Mesquite
Very Strong
3-5s
Earthy, spicy, sharp, Texas BBQ
The Savory Bridge: Connects vegetal flavors (agave) with citrus.
Tequila, Mezcal
Everything else
The classic "Margarita" smoke. Use less than you think.

Pecan
Medium
8-10s
Nutty, sweet, cooler than Hickory
Gold Rush, Espresso Martini
Burns cooler, preserving delicate nut oils.
Maple

8-10s
Sweet, syrup-like, creamy
Coffee cocktails, Rum
High sugar content in wood caramelizes slightly.

Floral, woody, less sweet than apple
Penicillin, Scotch
Subtle phenols don't fight peat smoke.
Peach
Mild
10-12s
Floral, sweet, perfumed
Bellini riffs, Vodka
Very light smoke density; good for visual presentation.
Grapevine
Medium
8-10s
Wine-like, tart, tannic
Negroni, Boulevardier
Contains tartaric acid from the vine, adding "grip."

II. SMOKE AS PROBLEM-SOLVER
Don't just smoke for show. Use smoke to fix an unbalanced cocktail.
Problem: Drink is too sweet/cloying.
The Fix: Use Hickory or Oak. The tannins in the smoke dry out the palate and cut the sugar.
Problem: Alcohol burn is too harsh.
The Fix: Use Cherry or Apple. The fruity sweetness masks the ethanol "bite."
Problem: Drink feels "thin" or watery.
The Fix: Use Olive or Pecan. The oils in the smoke add mouthfeel and weight.
Problem: Flavors aren't meshing (disjointed).
The Fix: Use Mesquite (for agave) or Oak (for whiskey). Smoke acts as a "bridge," connecting disparate ingredients like citrus and spirit.
III. THE SCIENCE OF SMOKE (Deep Dive)
1. Why Smoke Works
Alcohol is a solvent. When you smoke a cocktail, the smoke particles don't just sit on top; they dissolve into the alcohol. The phenolic compounds in the smoke chemically bond with the ethanol, changing the flavor structure of the liquid permanently.
2. The Bridge Theory
Smoke connects flavors.
Oak bridges the gap between Whiskey (grain) and Vermouth (grape) by highlighting common vanilla/tannin notes.
Mesquite bridges Tequila (vegetal) and Lime (acid) by adding a savory/salt element that both ingredients love.
3. The Maillard Reaction
When wood burns at the optimal temperature (smoldering, not flaming), it undergoes the Maillard reaction—the same browning chemistry that makes seared steak or toasted bread taste good. This creates hundreds of flavor compounds (furans, pyrazines) that liquid ingredients alone cannot provide.
4. Phenol Profiles
Different woods have different chemical fingerprints:
High Phenols (Guaiacol): Hickory, Mesquite. These taste "spicy" or "medicinal."
High Syringol: Maple, Cherry. These taste "sweet" and responsible for the smoky aroma without the bitter taste.
High Vanillin: Oak. Specifically American White Oak releases vanillin when burned, mimicking the taste of Bourbon barrel aging.
IV. SMOKING TECHNIQUES
1. The Rinse (Glass Smoking)
Method: Fill the glass with smoke, cover with a coaster, let sit for 5 seconds. Release smoke, then pour the cocktail in.
Effect: Lightest intensity. The drink smells smoky, but the liquid retains its original crispness.
Best For: Manhattans, Martinis, delicate wines.
2. The Bathe (Top-Down)
Method: Pour the drink, add ice, then place the smoker top on the glass and force smoke down into the liquid. Cap and let sit.
Effect: Medium intensity. Smoke clings to the ice and the wash line of the glass. Aroma hits with every sip.
Best For: Old Fashioned, Negroni, Rocks drinks.
3. The Infusion (Decanter/Cloche)
Method: Put the liquid in a decanter or the whole glass under a dome (cloche). Fill with dense smoke and let sit for 20+ seconds. Swirl the liquid to physically mix the smoke in.
Effect: High intensity. The liquid itself tastes smoky.
Best For: Bloody Marys, Tiki drinks, or "fixing" cheap whiskey.
