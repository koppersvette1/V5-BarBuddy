File 06.0 - Smoker Devices Guide Complete
BarBuddy V5 - Equipment Guide
Philosophy: The right tool makes smoking cocktails easy, safe, and consistent. This guide covers every device type with pros/cons, techniques, and purchasing recommendations.
THE 4 MAIN DEVICE TYPES
1. CHIMNEY SMOKER (The "Top Hat")
What It Is: A wooden or metal puck that sits directly on top of the glass. Wood chips go in a mesh basket in the center.
Best Brands: Aged & Ore, Foghat, generic "Cocktail Smoker Kits" on Amazon.
Pros:
✅ Easiest to use.
✅ Quick (10-15 seconds).
✅ Very portable.
✅ Visual appeal (smoke cascades down).
Cons:
❌ Can only smoke one drink at a time.
❌ Screen gets clogged with resin (needs cleaning).
Best For: Home bartenders, Old Fashioneds.
2. SMOKING GUN + CLOCHE (The Pro Setup)
What It Is: A handheld gun with a fan and hose. You light chips in the gun, and it pumps cold smoke through a hose into a glass dome (cloche) or box.
Best Brands: Breville (The gold standard), Crafthouse by Fortessa.
Pros:
✅ "Cold Smoke" prevents ice melt.
✅ Can smoke anything (cheese, meats, multiple drinks).
✅ Heavy smoke volume.
Cons:
❌ Expensive ($100-$150).
❌ More parts to clean/store.
Best For: Dinner parties, food & drink smoking, batching.
3. THE TORCH (Essential Companion)
Do not use a Bic lighter. You need a butane kitchen torch.
Why: Lighters produce soot and don't get hot enough to instantly ignite the wood chips. A torch provides a clean blue flame that forces ignition without flavor contamination.
Recommendation: Any refillable kitchen butane torch ($15-$25).
4. SMOKE PLANKS / BOARDS
What It Is: A block of wood you char directly, then place the glass upside down over the smoke.
Pros: No chips needed.
Cons: Messy (ash on the rim), hard to control intensity.
Verdict: Fun for show, but the Chimney Smoker is cleaner.
MAINTENANCE & CLEANING
The Resin Problem
Wood smoke creates resin (tar). Over time, the mesh screen in your chimney smoker will clog, preventing airflow.
The Fix:
Soak the metal mesh screen in Isopropyl Alcohol (rubbing alcohol) for 15 minutes.
Scrub with an old toothbrush.
Rinse with water and dry.
Frequency: Clean every 10-15 cocktails.
Butane Safety
Always let the torch cool down before storing.
Refill butane in a ventilated area.
If the torch "sputters," it usually means air is trapped in the tank. Purge it by pressing the refill valve with a pen before refilling.
COST VS. VALUE GUIDE
"I'm New to Cocktail Smoking"
Buy: Chimney Smoker Kit ($30-$50).
Why: Low investment, high reward, includes chips.
"I'm Serious / I Like Gadgets"
Buy: Breville Smoking Gun + Cloche ($150+).
Why: Versatility. You will eventually want to smoke cheese, popcorn, and charcuterie too.
"I'm on a Budget"
Hack: Use a wooden coaster or plank. Torch the wood, flip the glass over it to catch smoke. Cost: $0 (if you have wood).
