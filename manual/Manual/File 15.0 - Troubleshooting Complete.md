BarBuddy V5 - The Fixer
Philosophy: A bad drink can usually be saved if you understand the balance of Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Dilution. Don't pour it down the sink—fix it.
I. QUICK REFERENCE DIAGNOSTIC CHART
Problem
Likely Cause
The Fix (Action)
Too Sweet
Sugar/Syrup imbalance
Add Acid (Lemon/Lime) or Dryness (Bitters/Soda).
Too Sour
Acid imbalance
Add Sugar (Syrup) or Saline (Salt suppresses acid).
Too Bitter
Over-extracted or Campari
Add Salt (Saline). Salt magically blocks bitter receptors.
Too Strong (Burn)
Insufficient dilution
Stir/Shake longer with ice. Add a splash of water.
Too Weak (Watery)
Over-diluted
Add more spirit or a few dashes of bitters to firm it up.
"Something's Missing"
Lack of depth
Add Salt (2 drops saline) or Bitters. Express a citrus peel.
Flat (No Fizz)
Old soda or warm glass
Use fresh cold soda. Stir gently, don't shake carbonation.
Foam Won't Form
Old eggs or weak shake
Shake harder without ice (Dry Shake). Use fresh eggs.

II. FLAVOR CORRECTION SCIENCE
1. The Salt Hack (Saline Solution)
The Science: Sodium ions bind to bitter receptors on your tongue, temporarily blocking them. This allows sweetness and citrus to shine through.
The Recipe: Mix 20g Sea Salt into 80g Water (20% solution).
Usage: Add 3-5 drops to any drink that tastes too bitter or "muddy." It is the MSG of cocktails.
2. The Acid Adjust
Lemon vs. Lime: Lemon is softer/sweeter. Lime is sharper/more aggressive.
The Fix: If a drink is "cloying" (sticky sweet), adding more spirit won't help. You need acid to cut the sugar. Add 0.25 oz fresh lemon juice.
3. The Texture Fix
Thin/Watery Mouthfeel: Usually means you shook with "wet" ice or didn't use a rich enough syrup.
The Fix: Add 0.25 oz Rich Demerara Syrup (2:1 sugar). The extra sugar viscosity adds weight.
III. SMOKE TROUBLESHOOTING
Problem
Cause
The Fix
Acrid / Ashtray Taste
Stale smoke
Don't let smoke sit >2 mins. Serve immediately.
Bitter Smoke
Creosote buildup
Burning too hot or dirty smoker. Clean mesh screen.
No Smoke Flavor
Masking
Drink is too sweet/citrusy. Or used weak wood (Apple) on strong spirit.
Can't See Smoke
Wet chips
Chips must be bone dry. Microwave them for 10s to dry out.

IV. EQUIPMENT HACKS (The "MacGyver" List)
No Shaker? Use a Mason jar with a tight lid.
No Jigger?
1 Shot Glass = 1.5 oz
1 Tablespoon = 0.5 oz
1 Teaspoon = 0.16 oz (approx)
No Muddler? Use the handle of a wooden spoon.
No Mixing Glass? Use the pint glass part of your shaker or a heavy measuring cup.
No Fine Strainer? Use a clean tea strainer or hold the shaker gate very nearly closed.
V. THE "LAST RESORT" (Save the Party)
If a batched drink or pitcher is truly ruined:
Turn it into a Spritz: Dilute the mistake with lots of Club Soda or Prosecco. Bubbles hide many sins.
Make it a Slushie: Blend it with lots of ice. The cold numbs the tongue to flavor imbalances.
Add Bitters: A heavy dose of Angostura can shift a drink from "bad fruity" to "complex spiced."
