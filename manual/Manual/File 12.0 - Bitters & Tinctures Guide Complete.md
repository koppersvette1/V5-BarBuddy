File 12.0 - Bitters & Tinctures Guide Complete
BarBuddy V5 - The Spice Rack
Philosophy: Bitters are the "salt and pepper" of the bar. They bind flavors, add aromatic depth, and can rescue a drink that feels "flat." This guide covers usage, brands, and advanced DIY production.
I. THE BITTERS LIBRARY (Essential & Advanced)
TIER 1: THE NON-NEGOTIABLES (You must own these)
1. AROMATIC (Angostura)
Profile: Cinnamon, clove, allspice, dark fruit, gentian.
Best Brand: Angostura (The yellow cap is iconic for a reason).
Use: Old Fashioned, Manhattan, Champagne Cocktail.
The Rule: If a recipe just says "bitters," it means Angostura.
2. PEYCHAUD'S (Creole)
Profile: Anise, cherry, floral, lighter body.
Best Brand: Peychaud's (There is no substitute).
Use: Sazerac, Vieux Carré.
Note: Essential for New Orleans drinks. It is NOT interchangeable with Angostura.
3. ORANGE BITTERS
Profile: Bitter orange peel, cardamom, caraway, coriander.
Best Brand: Regan's No. 6 (Spicier) or Angostura Orange (Citrusier).
Use: Martini, Negroni, Gin drinks.
Pro Tip: Combine Regan's and Angostura Orange 50/50 ("Feegan's") for the ultimate house orange blend.
TIER 2: THE MODERN ESSENTIALS (Level Up)
4. BLACK WALNUT BITTERS
Profile: Rich, nutty, earthy, maple-like sweetness.
Best Brand: Fee Brothers Black Walnut.
Use: Fall/Winter Old Fashioneds, Manhattan riffs, or any drink with Maple Syrup.
Smoke Pairing: Cherry or Pecan wood.
5. ESPRESSO / COFFEE BITTERS
Profile: Roasted coffee bean, dark chocolate, vanilla.
Best Brand: Luxardo Espresso Bitters (The gold standard for depth).
Use: Espresso Martini, White Russian, or adding depth to a Rum Old Fashioned.
Why Luxardo: It has a distinct viscosity and intense roast profile that stands up to vodka.
6. CHOCOLATE / MOLE
Profile: Cacao, cinnamon, chili heat.
Best Brand: Bittermens Xocolatl Mole or Angostura Cocoa.
Use: Tequila/Mezcal Old Fashioneds. Bridges agave and oak perfectly.
7. GRAPEFRUIT
Profile: Bright, floral, bitter pith.
Best Brand: Scrappy's or Bittermens Hopped Grapefruit.
Use: Gin & Tonic, Paloma, Daiquiri. Adds a "fresh juice" illusion.
8. TIKI / ELEMAKULE
Profile: Cinnamon, allspice, ginger, island spice.
Best Brand: Bittermens Elemakule Tiki.
Use: Mai Tai, Zombie, Rum Punch. Adds "depth" to fruit juice bombs.
II. APPLICATION TECHNIQUES
1. THE DASH
Definition: A specific, deliberate shake of the bottle.
Technique: Turn the bottle completely upside down and thrust once.
Volume: Approx 1/8th teaspoon or ~1ml.
Japanese Dasher: If you transfer bitters to fancy glass bottles, be aware their "dash" is often smaller (1/2 standard dash).
2. THE RINSE
Use: When you want the aroma but not the bitter taste.
Method: Dash bitters into an empty glass, swirl to coat the walls, and dump the excess.
Drink: Sazerac (Peychaud's rinse is sometimes used instead of Absinthe).
3. THE ATOMIZER (Spray)
Use: For finishing touches on top of a drink (Egg white foam).
Method: Put bitters in a small spray bottle. Mist 2-3 times over the finished drink.
Result: Intense aroma on the nose without affecting the liquid flavor.
4. FOAM ART
Use: Pisco Sour, Amaretto Sour.
Method: Gently place drops of bitters on top of the egg white foam. Use a toothpick to drag through the dots, creating hearts or swirls.
