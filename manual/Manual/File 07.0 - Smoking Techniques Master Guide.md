File 07.0 - Smoking Techniques Master Guide
BarBuddy V5 - Execution
Philosophy: There's no single "right" way to smoke a cocktail. Master multiple techniques to match different situations, glassware, and desired intensity.
I. TECHNIQUE #1: GLASS SMOKE (Standard)
Best For: Old Fashioned, Negroni, Whiskey neat.
Intensity: Medium
Place Chimney smoker on the empty (or iced) glass.
Add pinch of wood chips.
Torch for 3-5 seconds until smoke cascades down.
Cap it and wait 10-20 seconds.
Remove smoker, pour drink/garnish, and serve.
II. TECHNIQUE #2: THE RINSE (Light Smoke)
Best For: Manhattan, Martini, Wine.
Intensity: Light
Smoke the empty glass first.
Cap it with a coaster to trap the smoke.
Stir your cocktail in a separate mixing glass.
Remove coaster (smoke releases), and immediately pour the liquid in.
Result: The glass smells smoky, but the liquid remains crisp and unaltered.
III. TECHNIQUE #3: THE BATH (Heavy Smoke)
Best For: Tiki drinks, Bloody Marys, Batched Cocktails.
Intensity: High
Pour the drink into a vessel (decanter or large jar).
Fill the vessel with smoke using a Smoking Gun.
Seal and swirl the liquid for 30 seconds.
Result: The smoke dissolves physically into the liquid. Every sip is smoky, even if you pour it into a fresh glass.
IV. TECHNIQUE #4: COLD SMOKE ICE
Best For: Subtle, evolving flavor.
Intensity: Variable
Place large ice cubes in a container/ziplock bag.
Fill with smoke and seal. Let sit for 5 minutes.
Use this ice in a normal non-smoked drink.
Result: As the ice melts, the smoke flavor slowly bleeds into the drink.
V. TROUBLESHOOTING
Problem
Cause
The Fix
Smoke tastes bitter/acrid
Over-smoking or Old Smoke
Smoke for less time (10s max). Don't let smoke sit in the glass for 2 minutes—it goes stale (stale smoke = ashtray taste).
No smoke produced
Chips too wet or Torch too weak
Ensure chips are dry. Use a jet torch, not a lighter. Hold flame directly on chips.
Smoke disappears instantly
Poor seal
Make sure the smoker sits flat on the rim. Wet the rim slightly to create a seal.
Drink tastes like campfire
Wrong wood
You probably used Mesquite or Hickory on a delicate drink. Switch to Apple or Cherry.
