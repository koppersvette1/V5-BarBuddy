Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Pineapple/OJ
That is a "Hawaiian Mai Tai," not the original
No juice except lime!

It is a Rum Sour modified with almonds and orange. Complex and earthy, not just "fruit punch."

Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Coconut Milk
Too watery, no sugar
Must use Cream of Coconut (sweetened syrup in a can)

Lime cuts the heavy sugar/fat content

Why It Works:

Dangerous intoxication
Originally served with a "Limit 2 per customer" rule

Skipping Campari
It's not a Jungle Bird without the bitter aperitif
