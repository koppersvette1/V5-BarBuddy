File 16.0 - Bar Tools Complete
BarBuddy V5 - The Armory
Philosophy: Buy nice or buy twice. You need very few tools, so get durable ones.
I. ESSENTIAL KIT (The "Must Haves")
Shaker (Boston): Two pieces (tin on tin). Seals better than glass.
Jigger (Japanese Style): Tall, narrow, precise markings (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 oz).
Hawthorne Strainer: Tight coil spring for filtration.
Fine Mesh Strainer: For double straining.
Bar Spoon: Weighted end, 30cm length.
Muddler: Flat bottom, unvarnished wood or plastic.
II. BUDGET BUILDING GUIDE
The "$50 Starter": Mason Jar (shaker), Shot Glass (measure), Chopstick (spoon), Kitchen Knife (peeler). Capable of making 80% of drinks.
The "$100 Upgrade": Boston Shaker set, Japanese Jigger, Hawthorne Strainer. Professional speed and texture.
The "Pro Tier": Mixing Glass (crystal), Smoking Gun, Clear Ice Molds. For presentation and advanced techniques.
III. CARE & MAINTENANCE
Shakers: Wash immediately after use (citrus corrosion). Leave open to dry to prevent smells.
Jiggers: Scrub the bottom inside corners where syrup gets stuck.
Smoking Guns: CRITICAL. Remove the mesh screen and soak in alcohol every 5-10 uses. Clogged screens ruin the motor.
Wooden Muddlers: Hand wash only. Dishwashers will crack the wood.
