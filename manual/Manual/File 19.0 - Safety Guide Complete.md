BarBuddy V5 - Safe Operations
Philosophy: Alcohol + Fire + Knives + Glass = Risk. Follow these protocols to keep the home bar safe.
I. FIRE SAFETY (Smoking Cocktails)
Surface: Always place the cocktail smoker/glass on a non-flammable surface (stone coaster, metal tray). Never on a tablecloth.
The Torch: Use a kitchen butane torch. Do NOT use a Bic lighter (soot/low heat). Do NOT use a propane garage torch (too hot/gas taste).
Extinguish: Ensure wood chips are fully extinguished before dumping them in the trash. Douse with water if unsure. Ash can smolder for hours.
Ventilation: Do not smoke cocktails in a small, unventilated closet. It sets off fire alarms.
II. FIRST AID PROTOCOLS
Minor Burns (Torch/Chips): Run under cool water for 10-15 minutes immediately. Do not apply ice directly. Apply burn cream/aloe after cooling.
Cuts (Glass/Knives): Apply pressure to stop bleeding. Clean with soap/water. Bandage. If glass is embedded, do NOT remove it—seek medical help.
Glass In Ice: If a glass breaks near the ice bin, DUMP THE ENTIRE BIN. Do not try to pick out shards. You will miss one.
III. ALCOHOL SAFETY & LIABILITY
Measurements: Use a jigger. Free pouring leads to over-serving. Standard drink = 2 oz of 40% spirit.
Monitoring: Watch for signs of intoxication. High-ABV drinks (Zombies, Martinis) hit harder than beer.
Hydration: The "One-for-One" rule—serve one glass of water with every cocktail.
The "Last Call": Stop serving alcohol 1 hour before the party ends. Switch to coffee/water.
