0.25 oz Crème de Violette (Essential for the color)
0.75 oz Fresh Lemon Juice

Common Mistakes:
Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Too much Violette
Tastes like soap or perfume
Use exactly 0.25 oz (a quarter ounce)
Skipping Maraschino
Loses the nutty base note
Must use Maraschino liqueur, not cherry juice

Why It Works:
A balance of sour (lemon), sweet/nutty (maraschino), and floral (violet).
One of the few naturally blue cocktails.
History & Context:
First published in Hugo Ensslin's 1916 Recipes for Mixed Drinks. For decades, it was made without Crème de Violette because the liqueur disappeared from the US market, making it just a "Gin Sour with Maraschino." When the liqueur returned in 2007, the drink regained its blue hue and iconic status.

Wrong flavor profile

Raspberry and lemon is a classic pairing.
Gin adds structure so it isn't just a smoothie.

Named after a men's club that met at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in the late 1800s. It was considered a "manly" drink until marketing shifted in the 1950s. It vanished for years before being revived by the modern craft cocktail movement.

Common Mistakes:
Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Too Sweet
Hemingway was diabetic; he hated sugar
Keep it tart; rely on Maraschino for sweetness
Canned Juice
Tastes metallic
Fresh grapefruit juice is essential

Why It Works:
A drier, more complex version of the Daiquiri.
Maraschino provides a nutty backbone to the bright citrus.
History & Context:
Created for Ernest Hemingway at El Floridita in Havana, Cuba. Hemingway famously said, "I drink to make other people more interesting." He preferred his with double the rum ("Doble") and no sugar, though modern palates usually prefer the Maraschino version listed here.
MOCKTAIL VERSION: "Writer's Block"
Category: Zero-Proof Sour

RECIPE #19: AMARETTO SOUR
Category: Sour (Shaken)
Base Spirit: Amaretto + Bourbon
ABV Level: Low-Medium (15%+)
Complexity: Easy
Glass: Rocks
Ice: Large cube
Method: Shake (Dry Shake)
Time to Make: 3 minutes
Standard Spec - "The Morgenthaler Method":
1.5 oz Amaretto (Disaronno or Lazzaroni)
0.75 oz Cask Strength Bourbon (Booker's or Knob Creek)
1 oz Fresh Lemon Juice
0.25 oz Simple Syrup
1 Egg White
Lemon twist & Cherry
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Add Amaretto, Bourbon, Lemon, Syrup, and Egg White to shaker
DRY SHAKE: Shake without ice for 15 seconds
WET SHAKE: Add ice, shake hard for 10 seconds
Strain over fresh ice
Garnish
Smoke Pairing (Optional):
Best Wood: Cherry
Time: 8-10 seconds
Note: Amazing pairing. The smoke boosts the almond/nutty notes.
Taste Profile:
Sweet: 4/5 | Sour: 3/5 | Bitter: 1/5 | Boozy: 2/5 | Fruity: 2/5 | Nutty: 5/5
Common Mistakes:
Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Only Amaretto
Too sweet and weak; tastes like candy
The bourbon is CRITICAL to give it backbone
Sour Mix
See previous notes
Fresh lemon is non-negotiable

Why It Works:
Amaretto is often too sweet on its own. The high-proof bourbon cuts through the sugar and adds oak character.
Egg white makes it a dessert-like texture.
History & Context:
The original 1970s Amaretto Sour was a dark mark on cocktail history—usually just Amaretto and sour mix. In 2012, bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler "fixed" the recipe by adding cask-strength bourbon and egg white, turning a joke drink into a respected classic.
MOCKTAIL VERSION: "Almond Sour"
Category: Zero-Proof Sour
ABV: 0.0%
Complexity: Medium
Glass: Rocks
Time: 3 minutes

2 oz Strong Black Tea (replaces bourbon body)
1 Egg White or Aquafaba
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Dry shake all ingredients
Wet shake with ice
Strain over fresh ice
Why It Works:
Orgeat is non-alcoholic almond syrup that perfectly replaces Amaretto.
Tea provides the tannins.

Ingredients:
3 oz Lemonade
0.5 oz Orgeat (Almond Syrup)
Cherry
Step-by-Step Instructions:

Common Mistakes:
Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Flat Soda
Drink tastes dead
Always use a fresh bottle/can of soda water
Too much syrup
Becomes lemon-lime soda
Keep it tart and crisp

Why It Works:
It is essentially a sparkling Gin Sour.
Definitive summer refresher.
History & Context:
Associated with the "Great Tom Collins Hoax" of 1874, where people would tell a friend that a man named Tom Collins was at a nearby bar talking trash about them. The friend would rush to the bar asking for "Tom Collins," and the bartender would hand them this sour cocktail.
MOCKTAIL VERSION: "Tim Collins"
Category: Zero-Proof Highball
ABV: 0.0%

Glass: Collins
Time: 2 minutes
Ingredients:
2 oz Non-Alcoholic Gin

Base Spirit: Pisco
ABV Level: Medium (20%+)
Complexity: Medium
Glass: Coupe or Rocks
Ice: None
Method: Shake (Dry Shake)
Time to Make: 3 minutes
Standard Spec - "The Peruvian Flag":
2 oz Pisco (Peruvian - Quebranta grape)
1 oz Fresh Lime Juice
0.75 oz Simple Syrup
1 Egg White
3 drops Angostura Bitters (garnish on top of foam only)
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Add Pisco, lime, syrup, and egg white to shaker
DRY SHAKE: Shake without ice for 15 seconds
WET SHAKE: Add ice, shake hard for 10 seconds
Strain into glass
The Art: Carefully drop 3 drops of bitters onto the white foam. Use a toothpick to drag them into heart shapes.
Smoke Pairing (Optional):
Best Wood: Apple
Time: 10-12 seconds
Note: Subtle fruit wood complements the grape spirit.
Taste Profile:
Sweet: 3/5 | Sour: 4/5 | Bitter: 0/5 | Boozy: 3/5 | Fruity: 3/5
Common Mistakes:
Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Mixing Bitters In
Turns the drink brown and bitter
Bitters sit ON TOP of the foam only for aroma
Wrong Lime
Key limes are closest to Peruvian limes
Use the tartest limes you can find

Why It Works:
Pisco is an unaged brandy made from grapes; it has a unique earthy/floral flavor.
The bitters on top provide aroma with every sip without making the drink bitter.
History & Context:
Invented by American bartender Victor Morris in Lima, Peru, in the 1920s as a riff on the Whiskey Sour. It is the national drink of Peru (and Chile claims it too).

Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Ginger Ale
Too sweet, no "kick"
Must use Ginger BEER (Fever-Tree or Bundaberg)
No Copper Mug

The copper keeps it frosty cold

Why It Works:
Simple, spicy, and refreshing.
The copper mug immediately transmits the cold to your lips/hand.
History & Context:
Invented in 1941 by John Martin (owner of Smirnoff) and Jack Morgan (owner of Cock 'n Bull Ginger Beer) in Los Angeles. Neither product was selling. They combined them, added a lime, and put it in a copper mug (which a friend needed to get rid of). It single-handedly popularized vodka in America.

Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Shredding Mint
Releases chlorophyll (bitter grass taste)
Press gently; don't grind

You lose the visual mint appeal
Build it in the glass

Why It Works:
Mint and lime are the ultimate cooling combination.
History & Context:
Origins are lost in time, possibly dating back to Sir Francis Drake in the 1500s (as "El Draque"). It became a hit at La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana. It is one of the most labor-intensive drinks for bartenders but beloved by customers.

Mistake
Why it fails
The Fix
Using Pink Juice
A Paloma uses SODA, not just juice
Must be carbonated grapefruit soda

Tastes flat
The salt makes the grapefruit pop

Why It Works:
Grapefruit soda is sweet, tart, and bitter all at once.
Much easier to make than a Margarita and often more refreshing.
History & Context:

Use a fresh bottle

Why It Works:
The ultimate low-ABV patio drink. Bittersweet and bubbly.
