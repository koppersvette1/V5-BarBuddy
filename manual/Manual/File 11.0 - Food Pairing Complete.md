File 11.0 - Food Pairing Complete
BarBuddy V5 - Pairing Engine
Philosophy: A cocktail pairing should either COMPLEMENT (match flavors) or CONTRAST (cut flavors).
I. PAIRING PHILOSOPHY
1. Complement (Match)
Strategy: Find a flavor note in the food and echo it in the drink.
Example: BBQ Ribs (Smoky/Sweet) + Smoked Old Fashioned (Smoky/Caramel).
Example: Ceviche (Citrus/Acid) + Margarita (Lime/Acid).
2. Contrast (Balance)
Strategy: Use the drink to fix a "problem" in the food (usually fat or heat).
Example: Fatty Steak + Tannic Red Wine/Manhattan (Tannins cut through fat).
Example: Spicy Tacos + Sweet/Tart Paloma (Sugar soothes the burn).
II. FOOD → DRINK PAIRING GUIDE
GRILLED / BBQ FOODS
Best Drinks: Smoked Old Fashioned, Dark 'n' Stormy, Bourbon neat.
Why: The char on the food matches the char in the barrels and the smoke in the glass.
Wood: Hickory or Mesquite.
SEAFOOD / RAW BAR
Best Drinks: Martini (Gin), French 75, Aperol Spritz.
Why: Delicate fish needs clean, crisp spirits (Gin/Vodka). Avoid heavy Oak/Whiskey which overpowers the fish.
Wood: Alder or Lemon Peel zest (no smoke).
STEAK / RICH MEATS
Best Drinks: Manhattan, Negroni, Cabernet Sauvignon.
Why: Fat coats the tongue. You need alcohol, tannins, or bitterness to "scrub" the palate clean between bites.
Wood: Oak or Cherry.
SPICY FOOD (Mexican, Thai)
Best Drinks: Margarita, Paloma, Riesling.
Why: Alcohol amplifies heat (makes it hurt). Sugar and Acid soothe heat. You want a low-ABV, sweet/sour drink.
Wood: Mesquite (lightly).
DESSERT / CHOCOLATE
Best Drinks: Espresso Martini, White Russian, Port.
Why: The drink must be as sweet as the dessert, or it will taste bitter.
Wood: Maple or Pecan.
CHEESE BOARDS
Hard/Aged Cheese (Cheddar, Parm): Old Fashioned (Whiskey cuts the salt crystals).
Soft Cheese (Brie, Goat): French 75 or Gin Fizz (Bubbles cut the creaminess).
Blue Cheese: Sweet Vermouth or Negroni (Salty/Funky + Sweet/Bitter).
III. SMOKE + FOOD RULES
1. Don't Double Up
If the food is heavily smoked (Texas Brisket), do not serve a heavily smoked cocktail. It destroys the palate. Serve a crisp, acidic drink (Whiskey Sour) to cut the richness.
2. Smoke as Seasoning
If the food is simple (Grilled Chicken, Veggies), use a Smoked Cocktail to add the "BBQ" flavor that the food lacks.
3. The "Bridge"
Use smoke to connect a dessert to a main course spirit. A Smoked Espresso Martini connects the coffee/chocolate of dessert with the savory campfire vibe of the meal ending.
