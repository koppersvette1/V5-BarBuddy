Philosophy: The glass determines the temperature, aroma, and wash line of the drink. Using the right glass is functional, not just aesthetic.
I. THE 12 ESSENTIAL GLASSES
1. ROCKS GLASS (Old Fashioned Glass)
Size: 6-10 oz
Best For: Old Fashioned, Negroni, Spirits neat.
Why: Wide opening releases aromatics; heavy bottom prevents warming from hand.
Smoke Compatible: ✅ Excellent. The standard for chimney smokers.
2. COUPE GLASS
Size: 5-7 oz
Best For: Manhattan, Daiquiri, Gimlet (Anything served "Up").
Why: Stem keeps hand away from bowl (keeping drink cold). Wide bowl aerates the liquid.
Smoke Compatible: ✅ Good. Easy to rest a smoker on top.
3. MARTINI GLASS (V-Glass)
Size: 4-6 oz
Best For: Martini, Cosmo.
Why: The V-shape allows the olive/twist to stand upright.
Smoke Compatible: ⚠️ Difficult. The steep sides make balancing a smoker puck hard. Use the "Rinse" technique.
4. HIGHBALL / COLLINS GLASS
Size: 10-14 oz
Best For: Mojito, Paloma, G&T.
Why: Tall column creates a bubble chimney, keeping carbonation fizzy longer.
