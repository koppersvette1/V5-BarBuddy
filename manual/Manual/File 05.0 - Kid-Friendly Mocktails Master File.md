6 oz Cola (Coke or Pepsi)
0.5 oz Grenadine (1 tablespoon)
1 Maraschino Cherry

RECIPE #2: SHIRLEY TEMPLE
Glass: Tall Highball (10-12 oz)
Ingredients:
6 oz Ginger Ale (or Sprite for sweeter taste)
0.5 oz Grenadine (1 tablespoon)

RECIPE #3: ARNOLD PALMER
Glass: Tall Highball
Ingredients:
4 oz Unsweetened Iced Tea
4 oz Lemonade
1 Lemon Wheel
Instructions:
