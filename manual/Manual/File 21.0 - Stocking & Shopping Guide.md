THE FUNCTIONAL MIXERS (The Secret Weapons)

THE "FUN" STUFF (Garnishes & Syrups)

Candy Garnishes: Gummy Worms, Swedish Fish, Cotton Candy, Candy Canes.
Rim Sugars: Colored sugar (Red, Blue, Green).

Honey & Agave Nectar: For Bee's Knees and Margaritas.
Salt: Sea Salt (Rims) and Saline Solution.
Eggs: For Egg White sours (or Aquafaba/Chickpeas).
Soda Water: Club Soda or Topo Chico (buy small bottles to keep fizz).
Tonic Water: Fever-Tree or Q Mixers (High quality matters).
Ginger Beer: Fever-Tree, Q, or Bundaberg (Spicy is better).
PART 5: THE "DO NOT BUY" LIST
Save your money. These are marketing gimmicks or low quality.
❌ Sour Mix: It tastes like chemicals. Just squeeze a lemon and add sugar.
❌ "Top Shelf" Vodka: Vodka is chemically neutral. Once you mix it with lime or ginger beer, you cannot tell the difference between a $20 bottle and a $60 bottle.
❌ Spiced Rum: It's usually full of artificial vanilla and added sugar. Make your own or use Aged Rum + Bitters.
❌ Flavored Whiskeys: (Apple/Cinnamon/Honey) - Way too sweet. Make a cocktail instead.
❌ Bottled Lemon/Lime Juice: It oxidizes and tastes metallic. Always buy fresh fruit.
